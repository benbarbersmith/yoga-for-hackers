Yoga For Hackers README
=======================

Seems silly to write a README for a text document, but this one is different.

Yoga For Hackers is an essay inspired by two things:

1. Too many members of the hacker community suffer from debilitating depression.
2. My own personal experience is that yoga is a really good mild anti-depressant.

This is currently a work in progress. The aims are as follows:

1. To end up with a document that provides useful resources for any hacker suffering from depression, even if it turns out that yoga is not part of the solution in their particular case.
2. In cases where taking up yoga may be helpful (this will not be all cases) to encourage those readers to do so.
3. Deliberately to have a presence on github in case it is helpful to anyone who randomly finds it there.4. When the document is reader for wider distribution, to have versions of it in a wide range of formats available, and to keep the source text under version control in order to be able to simultaneously update all formats as and when necessary.

For now there is nothing but a first draft (yogaforhackers.txt) and a TODO list of things to do.

'Bug' reports are welcome and encouraged.
