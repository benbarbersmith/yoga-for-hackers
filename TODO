YFH TODO
========

1 - Canvas opinion on content and edit until better. Needs to either be
longer or shorter. Currently can't tell.

2 - Convert to markdown. It sort of already is but isn't.

3 - Make HTML, PDF, Epub etc versions (maybe look at Leanpub?)

4 - Deploy online in as many readable formats as possible

5 - Add acknowledgements section. At very least thank Meredith Patterson
for her encouragement.

6 - Add dedication. Something like 'In memory of Len Sassaman, Aaron
Swartz, and those whose names we do not know' seems appropriate.

7 - If we are making this into a book / pamphlet thing, cover art

8 - Stop referring to yourself as we. Silly sod.
